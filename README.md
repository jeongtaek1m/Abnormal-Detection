# Deep Learning-based Abnormal Activity Recognition in Video

## üìÑ Overview
This repository presents a deep learning-based framework for recognizing abnormal activities in video data. By leveraging **optical flow** and **temporal feature learning**, our model effectively detects irregular events such as violent or non-violent scenes.

### Key Features
- **Fusion Model**: Combines 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNN) and optical flow for robust spatial-temporal pattern learning.
- **Optical Flow Implementation**: Includes custom implementations of **Lucas-Kanade** and **Farneback** algorithms for motion estimation.
- **Dataset Utilization**: Validated using the mini-RWF2000 dataset, with an ablation study highlighting the significance of optical flow integration.

## üõ†Ô∏è Model Architecture
The model integrates **optical flow** and **3D CNNs** to learn spatial and temporal features from video frames:
1. **Optical Flow**: Implements the Lucas-Kanade and Farneback algorithms for motion estimation.
2. **3D CNN**: Processes both **RGB channels** and **optical flow data** for time-sequential learning.
3. **Fusion Mechanism**: Combines outputs from RGB and optical flow channels for classification using a **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)**.
